# Authentication Feature

## Overview

The authentication system in Mozzy uses Supabase Auth with SSR integration for Next.js 14. It provides secure user authentication and session management through cookie-based token storage.

## Purpose and Goals

- Secure user authentication
- Session persistence across page reloads
- Role-based access control
- Server-side rendering support
- Efficient cookie management

## Key Functionalities

1. User Authentication:

   - Email/password login
   - OAuth providers (planned)
   - Session management
   - Token refresh

2. Authorization:

   - Role-based access control
   - Protected routes
   - API route protection

3. Session Management:
   - Cookie-based token storage
   - Automatic token refresh
   - Session recovery
   - Logout handling

## Dependencies

- @supabase/ssr: ^0.1.0
- @supabase/supabase-js: ^2.39.0
- next: 14.2.6
- middleware.ts for route protection

## Current State

- ✅ Basic authentication flow
- ✅ Cookie handling implementation
- ✅ Server component integration
- ⏳ Login form rendering fixes (in progress)
- ⏳ Token refresh optimization (in progress)
- ⏳ Error boundary implementation (planned)

## Known Limitations

1. Auth UI Rendering:

   - Intermittent issues with form display
   - Client-side hydration conflicts
   - CSS styling inconsistencies

2. Session Management:
   - Token refresh errors
   - Redundant cookie operations
   - Missing session recovery
